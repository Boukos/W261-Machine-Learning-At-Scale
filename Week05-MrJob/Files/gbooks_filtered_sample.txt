And now death is there	50	50	50
And now it is empassioned	71	71	69
And now my wanderings began	72	72	70
And now the king and	53	53	53

And so her eyes have	55	55	54
And so she found herself	107	107	106
And so the years roll	53	53	53
And so they were off	90	90	89
And so was too foolishly	244	244	239
And still in spite of	59	59	57
And study war no more	123	120	114
And such a black mass	54	54	41

And talking of burning in	68	68	67
And tell the Lord of	48	48	48

And there is none to	486	478	463
And there were still no	46	46	46
And there's nothing wrong with	1336	1330	1288
And there's so many of	42	42	42
And therefore it is strongly	46	46	46
And therefore their education must	73	73	73

And they came to Jesus	186	185	167
And they did just that	298	298	290
And they might well have	97	97	95

I showed the photo to	69	69	68
I shuddered for a moment	46	46	45
I silently deferred to his	62	62	62
I simply had to call	73	73	71
I simply stared at her	125	125	117
I sit at your feet	193	193	190
I slew him in the	45	45	45
I slipped my left hand	52	52	49
I smiled and waved at	160	160	155
I so far as the	40	40	40
I somehow made it to	70	70	67
I sometimes ask students to	75	75	74
I sometimes wondered whether this	42	42	42
I soon became impatient of	46	46	46
I sought high and low	40	40	40
I sought how I might	52	52	51
I speak of being in	125	125	123

I started a new book	54	54	54
I started to fight him	56	56	53
I started to see it	161	161	160
I stayed but two days	54	54	53
I stayed there four years	69	69	68

I stood up and smiled	156	156	150
I stooped and broke off	51	51	50
I stopped by the school	57	57	55
I stopped the taxi and	53	53	53
I stretched forth my hands	488	488	463
I strive to mix some	137	137	136
I strongly suspect I should	120	120	120
I strongly suspect him of	139	139	137
I studied Latin and Greek	45	45	45
I studied in the library	102	99	82
I studied it for several	64	64	63
I submit that the real	95	95	94
I submit this to your	185	185	174
I submit to your will	81	81	81
I succeeded in getting him	770	770	756
I suddenly found myself as	66	66	66
I suffered my mouth to	212	212	209
I suffered such agonies of	62	62	61
I suggest that this problem	77	77	77
I suggest that we sit	65	64	63
I suggest you choose the	45	45	45
I sung two or three	64	64	64
I suppose as a matter	109	109	108
I suppose has made fifty	49	49	49

I suppose she knows best	43	43	43
I suppose that is at	41	41	41
I suppose they will always	56	56	56
I suppose would his collection	92	92	91
I sure know how to	194	192	187
I suspect it had something	159	159	158
I suspect it was Dr	65	65	65
I suspect the use of	45	45	44
I suspect they would have	377	377	359
I swam to the boat	70	70	66
I swear some of them	61	61	61
I swear that by the	45	45	45
I sympathize with the urgent	71	71	70
I take a ride sometimes	57	57	57
I take a sip from	121	121	121

I talk to you so	96	96	94
I talked these things over	43	43	43
I talked with a young	494	493	483
I taste At first the	298	297	287
I tell her he will	55	55	55

I that am descended by	73	73	73
I then struck a light	43	43	43
I then the only one	95	95	95
I then turned to another	48	48	46
I therefore had no time	41	41	41
I think I got into	168	168	168
I think I will put	648	634	620
I think a mistake is	59	59	59
I think a very easy	42	42	42
I think about any of	46	46	46
I think after all the	85	85	85
I think also that our	99	99	99
I think for a long	375	375	371
I think he probably knew	91	91	90
I think he will live	284	281	275
I think he's in pain	64	64	53
I think his book is	59	59	58
I think if you compare	66	66	66
I think is the core	60	60	59
I think it best therefore	122	122	119
I think it's easy to	362	362	351
I think it's on the	376	376	369
I think my soul must	40	40	40
I think myself that his	79	79	79
I think now I must	144	144	143
I think our friend is	126	125	123
I think she might see	43	43	42
I think she was fond	102	102	102

I think the odds are	652	650	643
I think the question of	2090	2084	2017
I think the resolves of	70	70	70
I think the sooner we	895	890	865
I think the thing with	68	68	66
I think there is substantial	64	64	64
I think there's some of	81	81	79
I think they are learning	63	63	63
I think they sent me	60	60	57
I think they were planning	96	96	92
I think they were pleased	196	195	191
I think they were some	100	100	100
I think this colony is	45	45	45
I think this is such	200	200	198
I think this is your	811	805	786
I think to myself in	90	90	89
I think we may state	84	84	81
I think we must make	757	747	742
I think we should burn	82	81	80
I think we would normally	40	40	40
I think what your father	56	56	56
I think when there is	58	58	53
I think with respect to	131	131	129
I think you once gave	41	41	41
I think you should arrange	50	50	49
I thought I was boring	44	44	41
I thought I would paint	47	47	47
I thought about going after	53	53	53
I thought about the government	44	44	44
I thought again that it	50	50	49
I thought and thought how	59	59	59
I thought he seemed rather	548	548	542
I thought he seemed the	52	52	51
I thought him manly and	61	61	59
I thought how far we	40	40	40
I thought if I might	67	67	67
I thought it was about	3997	3981	3885
I thought it would hold	114	114	108
I thought it would set	75	75	73
I thought now that you	44	44	43
I thought of how the	1006	998	966
I thought of it last	264	264	263
I thought of the pleasure	542	542	542
I thought she was pretty	574	574	561
I thought that a lot	166	166	165
I thought that maybe after	50	50	49
I thought that was love	50	49	47
I thought the brew was	52	52	52
I thought the whole place	118	118	113
I thought then of what	51	51	50
I thought then they might	55	55	55
I thought they had killed	349	347	333
I thought this morning it	44	44	44
I thought what a nice	160	160	155
I thought with joy That	47	47	47
I thought would serve my	78	78	78
I thought you could find	95	95	95
I thought you were able	57	57	56
I thought you would really	45	45	45
I threw the book across	85	85	82
I thus wished to think	400	397	379
I to meet him often	132	132	130
I to understand from what	49	49	47
